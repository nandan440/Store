Clone:

1) use git clone url

2) there is one default branch ie. Main..

3) if we want to experiment something then we can create a branch and then we commit to that       branch then in future we can merge that in main branch/ main project by: git merge name_of_branch

4) to create new branch use : git branch branch_name
