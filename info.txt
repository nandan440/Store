step 1) use git init to intialise
step 2) can use git status to find if a file is in staging area or not..
step 3) to get a file in staging area use git add file_name or git add . For all file
step 4) now use git commit to commit ...by git cit is must but -m is optional it is to message with commit..
step 5) Eg: git commit -m "Completed module 1"..
step 6) we can see details of commit using git log command

7) we can use git diff filename this command show all the changes that I have done to file since last commit

8)to roll back to previous version of a file that is committed we can use git checkout filename.

9) now to push our file to GitHub repositories ..we need the url of repositories..
   And use git remote add origin https://github.com/nandan440/Store.git ....origin is a conventionally used name for the default remote repository..we can use any name in its place..

Working directory->staging area->local repository->remote repository..

10) then use git push -u origin main   .....here main is the name of brach as we are pushing all files to main branch.

Branch name is main and remote repository name is origin..
